          <h2>San Diego, Downtown</h2>
          <p>
            This picture was taken during my 2019 winter break while I was in San Diego. I was exploring the city at night looking for a nice composition to take a couple of night pictures, I came across San Diego's Convention center. It has a long staircase so I climbed it; on top the view was stunning as it was overlooking downtown, so I looked around and picked the composition I want and took the picture.

        <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4 order-md-2"><img src="img\pic-beach.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Beach"></div>
        <div class="col-12 bg-secondry col-sm-6 col-md-4 order-md-5">
          <h2>Matador Beach, Malibu</h2>
          <p>
            This picture was taken at Matador Beach in Malibu. The beach is known for its amazing rock formation which the waves breaks on them, which can make for very cool pictures. There are many vantage points and point of interest that can be used for many stunning compositions, there is also a cave very close to the beach that if you come at the right time you will be able to go inside.

          <h2>Los Angeles, Downtown</h2>
          <p>
            I took this picture in Downtown LA for a photo contest. The contest was cyberpunk themed, which means I had to find a location that is dark, sketchy and somewhat looks futuristic. Los Angeles proved a bit challenging to find a location with these specifications, unlike Seoul or Tokyo which are the best cities to be in for photographing a cyberpunk theme. After a month of looking around for a location that met the criterias, I finally found it, one thing I was also aiming for is to take the picture after a rainy day so the ground can be wet, which will reflect the city lights and make for a more dramatic picture.
